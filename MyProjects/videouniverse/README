Yesterday I attempted to add the registration page (per the lab we did together today in class) - today I hope
to get that ironed out so that I can move forward with restructuring my mapping so that it accurately reflects
the choices of the user who is currently on the app. I've got the registration part working - now just ironing
out the login page.

My best estimate for my project is that I'm a little more than halfway done.

During the weekend, I got the CRUD operations working for my Users & Wishlists working,
I am now in the process of designing pages so that you can choose which wishlist you
would like to view.

I am hoping to get sessions working so that I can display the wishlists for the current user only.
