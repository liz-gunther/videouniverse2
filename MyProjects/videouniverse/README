Got all my CRUD working, except for the add movie to a particular user's wishlist. I was able to update and
delete the current user, as well as create multiple wishlists for each user. I am having an issue with
deleting wishlists, as they are connected to multiple tables. I still haven't gotten a good start on my tests
yet, but I plan to start in earnest tomorrow.

I finally got the login/registration working. Now I'm retrofitting my CRUD operations and mapping so that it
accurately reflects the details of the current user. Tonight I plan on fixing the delete and add functions of
my wishlists. The idea is that each user can add/edit/delete wishlists -- I had the CRUD working before I added
security but now I'm struggling to understand how to assign the ID of each wishlist to the user that created
it.

I also plan on getting my tests finished up before the weekend is over. After that, most of the capstone requirements
will have been fulfilled.

Yesterday I attempted to add the registration page (per the lab we did together today in class) - today I hope
to get that ironed out so that I can move forward with restructuring my mapping so that it accurately reflects
the choices of the user who is currently on the app. I've got the registration part working - now just ironing
out the login page.

My best estimate for my project is that I'm a little more than halfway done.

During the weekend, I got the CRUD operations working for my Users & Wishlists working, I am now in the process
of designing pages so that you can choose which wishlist you would like to view.

I am hoping to get sessions working so that I can display the wishlists for the current user only.
