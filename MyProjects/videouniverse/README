My best estimate for my project is that I'm a little more than halfway done.

During the weekend, I got the CRUD operations working for my Users & Wishlists working,
I am now in the process of designing pages so that you can choose which wishlist you
would like to view.

I am hoping to get sessions working so that I can display the wishlists for the current user only.
